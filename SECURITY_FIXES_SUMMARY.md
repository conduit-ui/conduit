# Security Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the Conduit component delegation system.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Arbitrary Code Execution via shell_exec (CRITICAL)
**Location**: `StandaloneComponentDiscovery.php:113`
**Issue**: Direct execution of `shell_exec($binaryPath.' list --raw 2>/dev/null')` without validation
**Fix**: 
- Replaced `shell_exec()` with `Symfony\Component\Process\Process`
- Added binary path validation before execution
- Implemented timeout limits (5 seconds for discovery)

### 2. Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (HIGH)
**Location**: Component discovery and binary execution
**Issue**: User-controlled paths accepted without validation
**Fix**:
- Implemented path sandboxing to allowed directories only
- Added canonicalization to resolve `../` sequences
- Validate all paths are within expected component directories

### 3. Command Injection in Delegation (CRITICAL)
**Location**: `ComponentDelegationService.php:33`
**Issue**: Direct argument passing to Process without sanitization
**Fix**:
- All arguments now sanitized with `escapeshellarg()`
- Process uses array syntax instead of string concatenation
- Options properly validated and escaped

### 4. Component Name Injection (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Component and command names could contain shell metacharacters
**Fix**:
- Strict validation patterns for names (alphanumeric + limited chars)
- Length limits enforced (50 chars for components, 100 for commands)
- Invalid names rejected during discovery

### 5. Binary Integrity (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: No validation of binary permissions or ownership
**Fix**:
- Check binaries are not world-writable
- Verify binary exists and is executable
- Binary name must match component directory

## Implementation

### New Security Layer
Created `App\Services\Security\ComponentSecurityValidator` that provides:
- Centralized validation logic
- Path sandboxing
- Input sanitization
- Command building
- Binary integrity checks

### Integration Points
1. **StandaloneComponentDiscovery**: Now validates all discovered components
2. **ComponentDelegationService**: Uses security validator for all delegations
3. **Service Registration**: Security validator registered as singleton

### Testing
- Created comprehensive unit tests for security validator
- Added integration tests for end-to-end security scenarios
- All tests passing (44 tests, 134 assertions)

## Security Principles Applied

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers
2. **Fail Secure**: Invalid input rejected, not sanitized
3. **Least Privilege**: Components sandboxed to specific directories
4. **Input Validation**: All user input validated and sanitized
5. **Secure by Default**: No unsafe operations allowed

## Backward Compatibility

The security fixes maintain full backward compatibility:
- Valid components continue to work unchanged
- Only malicious/malformed input is rejected
- Error handling preserves existing behavior

## Recommendations

1. Regular security audits of component system
2. Monitor logs for security validation failures
3. Keep dependencies updated (especially Symfony Process)
4. Consider adding component signing in future
5. Implement rate limiting for component execution

## Verification

To verify the fixes:
```bash
# Run security tests
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/Services/Security/ComponentSecurityValidatorTest.php
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/ComponentSecurityTest.php

# Run full test suite
./vendor/bin/pest --parallel
```

All tests should pass, confirming the security fixes are working correctly while maintaining functionality.
